# Mr. Greedy

You are a mathematical comparison operator.
You look like `<` or `>`. And you are greedy.

Collect coins in this action-packed adventure
that takes place in a lush, two dimensional
universe. You can move left. You can move right.
The possibilities are endless.

Try to collect as many coins as you can! Some
coins are worth more than others. Once you
collect enough coins, you'll be greatly rewarded
by the mysterious Mr. Smiley. You'll have to
play to find out what happens when you catch him!

blows up for some reason, whoops, not my fault.
